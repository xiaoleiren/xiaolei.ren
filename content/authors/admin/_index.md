    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hello and welcome to my homepage! I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Macau University of Science and Technology.

My research is dedicated to the core challenges of software security. We focus on pioneering techniques in binary code analysis, compiler optimization, and code protection to uncover and fix deep-seated vulnerabilities, ultimately building a more secure digital world.

I am always looking for passionate and curious individuals to join my team. If you are excited about software security, low-level systems, or compiler technologies and are eager to make an impact, I would love to hear from you. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together!
